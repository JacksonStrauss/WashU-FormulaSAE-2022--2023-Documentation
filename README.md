# [WashU Formula SAE](https://sae.wustl.edu/) 2022-2023 Documentation

This repository holds some of the documentation for the research I performed and designs that I created for the WUFR-23 racecar during the [Formula SAE 2022-2023 season](https://www.fsaeonline.com/). Each subtopic will have its own folder in the repository with README files that explain everything. 

For the 2022-20223 season, I served as a member on the Powertrain subsystem of the team. My main goal was to research and design an optimal fuel tank for the car. I spent a lot of time learning about new topics on my own while also working with my teammates and asking for guidance from lead members. (Thanks everyone who helped me when I had questions.)

Since this was my first year being on the WashU Racing team, there was **_a lot_** of learning at the beginning of the semester followed by a time crunch to really design everything for the required deadlines by the end of the semester. We initially thought that we would design a 3D printed fuel tank for the car but ended up switching pretty late to a welded aluminum design. I'll go more into the reasoning behind this in the specific subtopic sections.

As of writing this, the season is not over so we'll see how things turn out!

## List of Topics in Repository:
* Material Selection for Fuel Tank
* Plastic Tank with Custom O-Ring
* Welded Aluminium Sheet Metal Tank
* Force Analyses of Tank
* Research on 3D Texturing
