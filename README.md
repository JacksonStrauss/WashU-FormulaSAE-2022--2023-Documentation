# [WashU Formula SAE](https://sae.wustl.edu/) 2022-2023 Documentation

This repository holds some of the documentation for the research I performed and designs that I created for the WUFR-23 racecar during the [Formula SAE 2022-2023 season](https://www.fsaeonline.com/). Each subtopic will have its own folder in the repository with README files that explain everything. 

For the 2022-20223 season, I served as a member on the Powertrain subsystem of the team. My main goal was to research and design an optimal fuel tank for the car. I spent a lot of time learning about new topics on my own while also working with my teammates and asking for guidance from lead members. (Thanks everyone who helped me when I had questions.)

Since this was my first year being on the WashU Racing team, there was **_a lot_** of learning at the beginning of the semester followed by a time crunch to really design everything for the required deadlines by the end of the semester. We initially thought that we would design a [3D printed fuel tank](https://github.com/JacksonStrauss/WashU-FormulaSAE-2022--2023-Documentation/tree/main/Plastic%20Tank%20with%20Custom%20O-Ring) for the car but ended up switching pretty late to a [welded aluminum design](https://github.com/JacksonStrauss/WashU-FormulaSAE-2022--2023-Documentation/tree/main/Welded%20Aluminum%20Sheet%20Metal%20Tank). I'll go more into the reasoning behind this in the specific subtopic sections.

As of writing this, the season is not over so we'll see how things turn out!
