# Plastic 3D Printed Fuel Tank with Custom O-Ring

For the 3D printed plastic fuel tank, there were a few design requirements that needed to be kept in mind. 
* The tank needed to have around 5 Liters of capacity.
* A taller fuel tank is sometimes better because it reduces the amount of sloshing in the tank. However, a shorter/flatter fuel tank makes it so that the fuel tank has a lower center of gravity. (You want to try and keep most components on a race car as low as possible because that keeps the car's center of gravity low and the tires get better grip on the road.) 
* The tank needed to attach via at least three easy to access tabs to the frame of the car.
* Try to keep the weight of the fuel tank as low as possible without risking structural integrity
* It's best to keep the fuel tank as far away as possible from the exhaust because using colder fuel runs the engine more efficiently. [(1)](https://www.racecar-engineering.com/articles/f1/technology-explained-f1-fuel-systems/)
* The fuel tank must have room for the Holley Hydramat at the bottom.
