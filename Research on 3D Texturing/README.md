# Research on 3D Texturing

One of the main research components for the fuel tank that I conducted for the 2022-2023 season was to determine whether it would be possible to incorporate a 3D bead pattern. This would increase the strength of certain material properties for the walls of the fuel tank while using less material at the same time. This technique of finding the optimal positions in space for where to place material and where to remove material in order to create a strong and efficient part is called [Toplogy Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology_optimization).

And so for the 3D printed plastic fuel tank, we were wondering whether adding 3D texturing would strengthen certain components as illustrated in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-ygdNQThAs). We wanted to replicate the types of bead patterns that can be found on common sheet metal products as seen in the video.
