# Material Selection for Fuel Tank

For the WUFR-22 car (the previous season), the team had decided to create a 3D printed fuel tank out of [Nylon PA 12](https://www.protolabs.com/media/1021634/sls-data-sheet-pa-12-white-f.pdf). The tank was printed as two separate parts and then would be connected together using fasteners. One half of the printed fuel tank had baffles in order to reduce the sloshing inside the fuel tank. 

This fuel tank concept was good in theory but had some issues that needed to be solved for the 2022-2023 season. For example, the Nylon PA 12 did not have a high enough [HDT (Heat deflection temperature)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_deflection_temperature) and so parts of the fuel tank deformed due to the heat that was radiating from the exhaust tubes. The fuel tank did not incorporate an O-ring/gasket and so fuel could easily escape the system. Lastly, because the baffles were connected from the top half of the fuel tank, air was trapped at the top of the fuel tank and reduced the amount of fuel the tank could hold. As such, the car ran out of fuel just as it was about to reach the finish line. (See image of trapped air in baffles below)

There are several other important factors to take into account when selecting the material of the fuel tank. Keeping the price of manufacturing the fuel tank is important because the team runs a tight budget and sometimes you have to prioritize cost efficiency over other capabilities of the design.
